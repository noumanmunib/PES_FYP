# Personalized Education Platform Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

The Personalized Education Platform is a web-based application that leverages machine learning algorithms to deliver tailored learning experiences for students. By analyzing student performance, preferences, and learning styles, the platform generates personalized learning pathways to enhance student engagement and academic achievement.

## Project Domain / Category

**Web Development**

## Abstract / Introduction

This project aims to create a dynamic and adaptive educational environment where students receive personalized content based on their unique learning needs. The platform integrates data analytics and machine learning techniques to assess student progress and provide recommendations for supplementary materials, activities, and assessments that align with the student's strengths, weaknesses, and goals.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login for users to access the platform.
- **User Profile:** Personalized profiles to manage personal information, preferences, and learning goals.
- **Assessment:** Diverse assessments including quizzes, exams, and assignments to evaluate knowledge and skills.
- **Recommendation System:** Machine learning algorithms analyze assessment results to generate personalized learning pathways.
- **Content Management:** User-friendly interface for managing educational content such as videos, articles, and interactive exercises.
- **Learning Pathways:** Tailored learning paths based on individual assessment results and goals.
- **Progress Tracking:** Mechanism for users to track their performance, achievements, and areas needing improvement.
- **Reporting:** Comprehensive reports on performance and learning outcomes to inform teachers and administrators.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Material UI, Chakra UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Machine Learning:** Python, TensorFlow (for the recommendation system model)

## Methodology

The platform is built using the MERN stack, incorporating Material UI and Chakra UI for a modern and responsive user interface. Machine learning algorithms, developed with TensorFlow, analyze student data to identify patterns and generate personalized learning pathways. These pathways are designed to cater to the individual needs of students, helping them improve in specific areas based on their preferences and performance.

## Expected Outcomes

- A functional and responsive education platform delivering personalized learning experiences.
- Machine learning models capable of analyzing student data to create custom learning paths.
- Enhanced student engagement and academic performance through tailored educational content.
